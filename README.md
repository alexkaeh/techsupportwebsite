# Tech Support Website

I do some freelance tech support for small businesses, and I needed a website.

* This website coexists with an older Wordpress installation, which is bypassed using a modification to the htaccess file.
* I wanted it simple and fast, so it's bare HTML + Bootstrap for styling.
